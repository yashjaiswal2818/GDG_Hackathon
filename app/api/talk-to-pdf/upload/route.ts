- Encrypted or password-protected PDF
- Corrupted file
- Unsupported PDF format
- Server processing limitations

For demonstration purposes, here's sample content about PDF analysis:

PDF documents can contain various types of content including text, images, tables, and formatting. The TalkToPDF system is designed to extract and analyze text content from PDF files to enable intelligent question answering and mind map generation.

Key features of the system include:
- Text extraction from PDF documents
- AI-powered question answering using Gemini
- Automatic mind map generation
- Interactive document analysis interface

This is a sample document that demonstrates the TalkToPDF functionality. You can ask questions about this content and generate mind maps to visualize the information structure.`;
