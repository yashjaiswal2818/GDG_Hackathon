# MentorAI - Comprehensive AI Learning & Startup Development Platform

## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Challenge
The modern entrepreneurial and educational landscape faces several critical challenges:

1. **Startup Development Complexity**: Entrepreneurs struggle with creating comprehensive startup packages that include market research, financial projections, brand identity, and presentation materials. The process is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expertise across multiple domains.

2. **Learning Accessibility**: Traditional learning methods are often rigid, expensive, and don't adapt to individual learning styles. Students and professionals need personalized, interactive learning experiences that are available 24/7.

3. **Content Creation Barriers**: Creating professional visual content, audio materials, and presentations requires specialized skills and expensive tools that many individuals and small businesses cannot afford.

4. **Knowledge Processing**: Processing and understanding large documents (PDFs, research papers) is time-consuming and often requires multiple tools and manual effort.
